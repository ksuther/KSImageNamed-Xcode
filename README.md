# KSImageNamed-Xcode
---

## What is this?

Can't remember whether that image you just added to the project was called `button-separator-left` or `button-left-separator`? Now you don't have to, because this will autocomplete your `imageNamed:` calls like you'd expect. Just type in `[NSImage imageNamed:` or `[UIImage imageNamed:` and all the images in your project will conveniently appear in the autocomplete menu. You'll even get a handy preview of the image you're about to select.

## How do I use it?

Build the KSImageNamed target in the Xcode project and the plug-in will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. Relaunch Xcode and `imageNamed:` will magically start autocompleting your images.

## What does this work with?

Developed and tested against Xcode 5 and 5.1DP1. Xcode 4.6 is no longer supported.

## How do I include file extensions when autocompleting?

Enter the following command and relaunch Xcode:  
`defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode KSShowExtensionInImageCompletion -bool YES`

## Possible future improvements

Ideas for people who might want to hack on this:

1. Only include images that are in the current project. Currently all images in the workspace are shown.
2. Show an image preview and dimensions when clicking on an imageNamed: string in the editor
3. Switch to ARC since garbage collection support has been dropped
